# cliche, right?

Our take on the "cliche" theme revolves around the iconic catchphrase of this character, SCP-2020. In the shape of alien, this "entity" wishes to be a scifi novel writer, and always comes up with some cliche story plots. 

In this game, each story is a playable minigame (at the moment for a total of 2 *to be expanded, maybe*) which, if completed, will give you points up to an amount of 100 every time. The game goes on, with increasing difficult, until you fail. 

Your total score will be the sum of your partial scores.

Have fun <3
